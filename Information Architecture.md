[[Eight Principles of Information Architecture]] by Dan Brown

[[Information Architecture Strategy]]

## The Value for the User
We have to deliver the right value at the right time if we want to satisfy users' desire for instant gratification. If the process of finding information is too slow, the user will get discouraged.

#### User Needs:
- **Known-item seeking**: Users will come to the service looking for something desirable and known.
- **Exploratory seeking**: Users will come to the website looking for inspiration. Something desirable, but not sure what it is.
- **Exhaustive research**: Users might be in a process of exhaustive research. They want to gather as much information as possible.
- **Re-finding**: A user needs a desired item again and is trying to find it.

#### Key Question
How are different users going to navigate, search or filter our content?

## The Value for the Business

Information Architecture can play a crucial role in:
- **Employee Productivity:** Bad IA can lead to redundancy and loss of productivity by employees. In 1999, a study showed that employers lost an average of 5000 dollars yearly to this.
- **Sales and Reputation**: If users cannot find the desired options or products, conversions will go down, which will mean less business for the company. Users will go for competitors, and this will spread through word of mouth.
- **Acquiring new Members**: If getting new members is the objective, the sign-up pages should be carefully crafted to retain the users. If it's too complicated, no one will sign up.
- **Reducing Marketing Costs**: If users cannot easily find desirable information, products or services, marketing costs will go up as they will have to make up for the IA inefficiency.
- R**eputation and SEO ranking**: Search engines rank websites depending on their usability and accessibility. 
- **Reducing the cost of customer support**: When the IA makes it easy for users to find what they are searching for, the cost of live support will decrease significantly and so will the need of the written documentation.
