With the objective of learning more about the textile industry, both theoretically and practically, I have set out the task of designing and making a shirt from scratch. I am completely new to fashion and textiles, so it should be a challenge.


## User Stories / Requirements

First, some requirements from my side as the end user of this product:


### User Scenario

IÃ±igo: *"I love to go hiking in the forest, and often I like to go off the marked path and explore more wild and challenging areas. Most of the time, however, I hesitate to do so because I am scared that my skin will get bruised, scratched, and stung by all kinds of bugs. I would love to have a shirt that takes away all these concerns and lets me explore at will."*

These are the aspects I considered when designing my shirt:

1. **[[Hiking Shirt Project - Fabric Selection|Fabric Selection]]**: Choose a fabric that is lightweight, breathable, moisture-wicking, and quick-drying. Common options include synthetic materials like polyester or nylon blends, or natural fibers like merino wool. Consider the shirt's insulation properties based on the expected hiking conditions (e.g., warmer or colder climates).

2. **Fit and Comfort**: Aim for a comfortable fit that allows freedom of movement. Consider factors such as sleeve length, torso length, and the ability to layer the shirt with other garments. Incorporate stretch panels or gussets in areas that require extra mobility, such as the shoulders or underarms.

3. **Moisture Management**: Ensure effective moisture management to keep the wearer dry and comfortable during physical activity. Incorporate features like mesh panels, underarm vents, or strategic placement of breathable fabrics to enhance airflow and ventilation.

4. **Sun Protection**: Integrate UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) into the fabric to shield the wearer from harmful UV radiation. Consider longer sleeves, a higher collar, or the ability to roll up sleeves for additional sun protection options.

5. **Durability**: Hiking involves exposure to rugged terrain, branches, and potential abrasion. Select durable fabrics and reinforce high-wear areas, such as the shoulders or backpack contact points, with reinforcements or tougher materials.

6. **Pockets and Storage**: Design functional pockets for storing essentials like maps, snacks, or small gear items. Consider the placement, accessibility, and security of the pockets to ensure convenience while hiking.

7. **Seams and Stitching**: Employ high-quality stitching techniques to enhance durability and prevent chafing. Flatlock seams or seamless construction can reduce friction points and increase comfort.

8. **Layering Compatibility**: Ensure the shirt can be easily layered with other garments, such as base layers or outer shells, to accommodate varying weather conditions during hikes.

9. **Odor Control**: If using synthetic materials, consider incorporating anti-microbial or odor-resistant treatments to prevent the buildup of unpleasant odors during extended hiking trips.

10. **Aesthetics**: Consider the overall design and aesthetics of the shirt, including color choices, patterns, and branding, to create an appealing and distinctive product.

11. **Sustainability**: If possible, select fabrics and production methods that align with sustainable practices to reduce the environmental impact of the shirt.

12. **User Feedback and Testing**: Continuously gather feedback from hikers or outdoor enthusiasts, and conduct thorough testing to refine the design and ensure it meets the specific needs and preferences of the target users.
