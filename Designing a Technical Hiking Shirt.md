With the objective of learning more about the textile industry, both theoretically and practically, I have set out the task of designing and making a shirt from scratch. I am completely new to fashion and textiles, so it should be a challenge.


## User Stories / Requirements

First, some requirements from my side as the end user of this product:


### User Scenario

IÃ±igo: *"I love to go hiking in the forest, and often I like to go off the marked path and explore more wild and challenging areas. Most of the time, however, I hesitate to do so because I am scared that my skin will get bruised, scratched, and stung by all kinds of bugs. I would love to have a shirt that takes away all these concerns and lets me explore at will."*
