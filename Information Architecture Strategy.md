1. Group and label the content
	- Make a list of all the content.
	- Group it and prioritize it.
		- [[Card sorting]] is a good technique for this.
	- Groups can be refined into a menu or a sidemap.

2. Define navigation and create site map
	- Information Architecture is the backbone of a website.
	- Create a sitemap
		- Get the grouped and labeled content
		- Present it in a diagram with its correspondent relationships and dependencies.
	- Define the navigation
		- UI elements that connect resources in the website
		- Menus, local navigation, breadcrumbs, filters, footers...

3. User Testing
	- Test early and test often
	- N&N suggest the following IA tests, depending on the design phase and goals:
		1. Tree Testing
			- Can the key information be found on the website?
			- Participants navigate through the website using only link names.
			- It shows us:
				- whether categories are understandable,
				- if they convey the content correctly,
				- if they are categorized in a user-centered manner,
				- if the titles are distinguishable from one another,
				- and if the information is easy to find.
		2. Closed [[Card sorting]]
			- Determines the strength of the category names.
			- Shows if the names of the categories are accurately conveys and if they accurately convey the content.
			- Also shows if the categorization is done in a user-centered manner and if the titles are distinguishable from one another.
		3. Click Testing
			- Shows how users interact with the existing UI components.
			- Which navigation elements are used and which are overlooked or avoided?
		4. Usability Testing
			- How and why do users use a website or product?
			- Reveals how users find information, which ways do they use it and which do they ignore or just don't use and why.
