The Buddha taught that the three types of craving are the root cause of suffering. These are:

1.  Craving for sensual pleasures (kama-tanha) - the craving for physical and sensory pleasures such as food, sex, and entertainment.
    
2.  Craving for existence or becoming (bhava-tanha) - the craving for continued existence, either in this life or in future lives. This craving is fueled by the belief in a separate and enduring self.
    
3.  Craving for non-existence or annihilation (vibhava-tanha) - the craving for escape from painful experiences or from existence itself. This craving is rooted in ignorance of the true nature of reality.
