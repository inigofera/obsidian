Many people look for 1 factor that is THE factor of quality. You see this all the time (fabric analog - thread count in sheets).

I'm not going to hold up a Zegna suit and say "man IDK about quality - that men's wearhouse suit was way thicker."

Its tough to understand all the components that make a good fabric. "heavy = quality" is easy to think and it makes sense that brands, seeking to maximize revenue, would sell to that thought.

Cool that Momotaro - master of the details - comes out and explains their prioritization of quality over something perceived as a giveaway sign of quality.

I've got PBJ, Oni, Tanuki, but the pair I have where every detail stands out, from denim, to patch, to stitching, to pockets, to rivets, to construction detail, etc, is Momotaro.

There really are a shitload of factors at play. What makes one fabric good for one purpose would make it bad for another purpose. It's not even something that you can put a universal checklist together for and say whichever fabric ticks the most boxes is the best fabric. It is a bit easier to put such a checklist together for a specific class of fabric like denim though.

Lets use this sheets example for why its complex and not just a simple checklist: The sheets thing is more than thread count...weave is also important. You can get a 900 PPI(picks per inch) sateen sheet and put it next to a 600 PPI poplin sheet and the poplin sheet will be better every time. Sateen weave is used to cheat actually. Its a lot easier to cram a bunch of threads together when they arent going over and under every single perpendicular thread(like a poplin weave does)...which means you can use cheaper(thicker) yarns to get a higher thread count. For a poplin weave you need to use much finer yarns(and thus longer cotton fibers) to get those high thread counts....consumers are mostly ignorant of this and only buy based on thread count. The more you know.

A cotton fiber has texture on its surface. When yarns are spun the surfaces of 2 fibers are twisted together and by friction are held in place. Do this a bunch and you get a yarn.

The longer the fiber is the more twists you can get between 2 fibers. The more twists you get the stronger the yarn. It also allows for thinner yarns because you don't need as many fibers to get enough twists to hold the yarn together.

So think of it like Legos. If you wanted to make a 1-foot stick of Legos 2 bricks high you will have a much stronger stick if you interlock 2x10 bricks than if you just use 2x6 bricks. But if you make the stick 3 blocks high, you can get quite a bit stronger stick with those 2x6 blocks. The more height and width you allow that stick to be, the smaller your building blocks can be and still make the stick pretty strong, up to a point. There is still a minimum brick size to build a strong stick, so you probably can't use 2x1 bricks to make a strong stick.

The other factor with ELS (Extra Long Staple?) is fewer ends of fibers sticking up out of the yarn per inch. This means you get smoother fabrics.

So the advantage of ELS is the ability to spin thinner yarns, stronger yarns and smoother yarns.

There is also a point of diminishing returns as illustrated with the Lego story. You probably won't get a substantially stronger stick by using 2x10 bricks than by using 2x6 bricks once your stick is 5 bricks high by 5 bricks wide...and you may still need to build other shit with the long bricks so why waste em.
