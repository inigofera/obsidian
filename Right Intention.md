One of the components of [[The Noble Eightfold Path]] in Buddhism. It refers to cultivating the right intentions or motivations in one's thoughts and actions, with the aim of reducing suffering and developing greater wisdom and compassion.

In Buddhist teachings, the Right Intention path involves two main components:

1. [[Renunciation]]: This refers to the intention to let go of attachment and craving for worldly pleasures and desires, recognizing that they are impermanent and ultimately unsatisfactory. Renunciation involves developing a sense of contentment and detachment from worldly things, and cultivating a desire for spiritual growth and development.

2. Non-harming: This refers to the intention to act with kindness, compassion, and ethical conduct towards oneself and others. Non-harming involves developing a sense of empathy and compassion towards all beings, and avoiding actions that cause harm or suffering to oneself or others.

The Right Intention path is seen as a crucial aspect of the spiritual path, as it helps to develop a more positive and wholesome state of mind, and leads to actions that are in alignment with the principles of the Buddha's teachings. By cultivating the right intentions, one can develop greater insight and understanding of the nature of reality, and move towards liberation from suffering.
