"Don't mix apples with oranges in your navigation scheme."

### Concept
Navigation menus should have one defining criterion that defines the separate selectable categories.

### Application
The author incorporates four navigation mechanisms (on a content based site):
- Topic Navigation: The main topic areas of the site.
- Timely Navigation: Short menu with links that are relevant due to the time or season.
- Signpost Navigation: A menu appearing on destination pages that reveals how the page is classified.
	- Gives users the opportunity to discover and explore these categories.
- Marketing Navigation: Appears next to the topic navigation and provides links to services offered by the organization.
