One of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].

This truth teaches that it is possible to end suffering by letting go of [[Craving]], [[Ignorance]] and [[Attachment]]. The Buddha taught that it is possible to attain a state of peace and happiness by developing [[Detachment]], and by cultivating wisdom and compassion. This means that if we can eliminate these causes, we can put an end to the cycle of suffering and attain a state of lasting peace and happiness.

According to the Buddha, this state of cessation or extinction is not a state of annihilation or non-existence, but rather a state of profound insight and freedom. It is the state of Nirvana, which is often described as the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice.

Nirodha is not just a theoretical concept in Buddhism; it is something that can be directly experienced through the practice of mindfulness and meditation. By developing greater awareness and insight into our own minds and the nature of reality, we can begin to let go of our attachment to our own ego-centered concerns and see the world with greater clarity and wisdom.

Ultimately, Nirodha represents the possibility of liberation from the cycle of suffering and the attainment of a state of true peace and happiness.
