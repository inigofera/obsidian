"Assume at least half of the website visitors will come through some page other than the home page."

### Concept
- Most traffic comes from a redirection from another site or a side door.
- This is mostly due to search engines not linking to the Home Page, but to a specific place in the site's hierarchy that is more relevant to the user's request.

### Application
- A destination page (so not a main home page) has to also help users understand what else they can find on the site.
	- This way, we can tell users that come through an outside link or search engine where they are and what else they can do while they are here.
- A good home page does not have to do everything.
	- It should exemplify the breadth of information on the site, but not reveal every last piece of content.
	- They should be about getting new users to understand what the website is all about, not about linking to every nook and cranny of the site.
