Do I need this item? Or do I just want this item?

Sometimes marketing creates an illusion within ourselves that leads us to think that we have a necessity that can be covered by what it is selling.

"I didn't know I needed this until now." â†’ You don't need it.

It is always worth it to examine a "need" that we are perceiving within ourselves. Most of the times, this need:
- Has been completely manufactured by a marketing team.
- Can be addressed in a way that does not cost money / that much money.
