Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment with a non-judgmental and curious attitude. It involves observing one's thoughts, feelings, and sensations without getting caught up in them or reacting to them.

[[Living in the present]] moment is a key aspect of mindfulness. It means being fully aware of what is happening right now, without dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. When we are present, we are more able to appreciate the beauty and richness of our lives, and we are better able to respond to situations with clarity and wisdom.
