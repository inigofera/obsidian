- It is important to know how to present information in a way that is understandable for everyone.
- An important feature for capturing the nature of the data is their central tendency.
- **Mean, median and mode** are the three most popular values.
	- Mean: Arithmetic average of all values/readings.
		- Using the mean for discrete, qualitative or non-continuous data often makes no sense.
	- Median: After ordering all the readings in ascending order, the median is the middle value.
	- Mode: The most frequently appearing value.
	- The three don't give back the same results, but this only means that they should be complemented with each other
- Mean, median and mode don't capture data **dispersion** accurately.
	- The **standard deviation** captures this dimension. It is the standardized (square root) version of the average of all values' deviations versus the mean.
	- **Range** also measures dispersion. It is the difference between the maximum and minimum values
