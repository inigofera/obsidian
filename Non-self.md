The concept of non-self (also known as anatta in Pali) refers to the understanding that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul that underlies a person's existence.

According to Buddhist teachings, everything in the universe is in a constant state of flux and change, including our thoughts, feelings, and physical bodies. Because of this impermanence, there is no fixed or permanent self that can be identified or clung to.

Instead, the self is seen as a composite of various mental and physical processes that arise and pass away in each moment. These processes are believed to be interdependent and constantly changing, and there is no fixed or permanent entity that can be identified as "me" or "mine."

The realization of non-self is seen as a liberating insight that can help to reduce attachment, craving, and suffering. By understanding that there is no fixed or permanent self, we can learn to let go of our attachment to our ego-centered concerns, and develop a greater sense of interconnectedness with all beings and phenomena.

The concept of non-self is closely related to the Buddhist teaching of dependent origination, which explains how all things arise in dependence on other factors, and that nothing exists independently or in isolation. Together, these teachings help to develop a more holistic and integrated understanding of reality, and provide a framework for living a more compassionate and awakened life.
