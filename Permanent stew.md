Idea for a stew that is never finished:
- The pot is never empty.
- It is a perpetual work in progress.

The main idea would be to start with a complete stew and then establish a rotation of ingredients to be added every day:

- Day 1: Onion, spring onion, garlic.
- Day 2: Carrot.
- Day 3: Tomato, celery.
- Day 4: Beans.

Cyclically, add the ingredients specified below daily, with a bit of broth every day.
