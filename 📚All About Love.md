Written by bell hooks.

[[Love]] is...
- the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.
- an act of [[Will]], both an intention and an action.
- choice. We do not have to love. We choose to love.
- care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, trust, communication.
- an action, rather than a feeling.

Men can return only to love by repudiating the will to dominate. Men dominate with violence:
- Physical violence
- Psychological violence
	- Lying (even witholding information)
	- Manipulating
	- Gaslighting
When we want to maintain [[Power]] over someone, we lose the capacity to love or be loved by them. Trust is the foundation of intimacy. When lies erode trust, genuine connection cannot take place. While men who dominate others can and do experience care, they are placing a barrier between themselves and the experience of love.
