[[Love]] is...
- the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.
- an act of [[Will]], both an intention and an action.
- choice. We do not have to love. We choose to love.
- care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, trust, communication.
- an action, rather than a feeling.

Men can return only to love by repudiating the will to dominate. Men dominate with violence:
- Physical violence
- Psychological violence
	- Lying (even witholding information)
	- Manipulating
	- Gaslighting

When we want to maintain [[Power]] over someone, we lose the capacity to love or be loved by them. Trust is the foundation of intimacy. When lies erode trust, genuine connection cannot take place. While men who dominate others can and do experience care, they are placing a barrier between themselves and the experience of love.

When we hear another person's thoughts, beliefs, and feelings, it is more difficult to project on to them our perceptions of who they are. It is harder to be manipulative. At times women find it difficult to hear men have to say when what they tell them does not conform with their fantasies of who men are or who they want them to be.

The wounded child inside many males is a boy who, when he first spoke his truths, was silenced by paternal sadism, by a patriarchal world that did not want him to claim his true feelings. The wounded child inside many females is a girl who was taught from early childhood that she must become something other than herself, deny her true feelings, in order to attract and please others. When men and women punish each other for truth telling, we reinforce the notion that lies are better. To be loving we willingly hear the otherâ€™s truth, and most important, we affirm the value of truth telling. Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love.
