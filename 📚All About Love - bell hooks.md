[[Love]] is...
- the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.
- an act of [[Will]], both an intention and an action.
- choice. We do not have to love. We choose to love.
- care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, trust, communication.
- an action, rather than a feeling.
