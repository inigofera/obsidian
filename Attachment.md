Attachment (upadana in Pali) refers to the strong clinging or grasping to things or experiences, which leads to [[Suffering]]. It is a mental state of being overly fixated on something or someone, which can cause us to feel incomplete or lacking without it.

Attachment arises from the craving or desire for something to be a certain way or to remain unchanged. It can take many forms, such as attachment to material possessions, relationships, ideas, beliefs, or even to our own identity. Attachment can also be subtle, such as when we cling to our views, opinions, or expectations.

The Buddha taught that attachment is one of the root causes of suffering, along with [[Ignorance]] and [[Craving]]. By holding onto things that are impermanent and subject to change, we set ourselves up for disappointment and frustration when they inevitably pass away or fail to meet our expectations.

The Buddha taught that the way to overcome attachment is to develop wisdom and insight into the true nature of reality. This involves recognizing that all things are impermanent, constantly changing, and devoid of a separate and enduring self. By cultivating a deeper understanding of the nature of existence, we can gradually let go of our attachments and experience greater peace and contentment.

Through the practice of mindfulness and meditation, we can learn to observe our thoughts and emotions without being consumed by them. This allows us to develop a greater sense of detachment from our habitual patterns of clinging and grasping, and to cultivate a more skillful and compassionate way of relating to the world around us.
