Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be obtained only by someone who is detached. ”  
― [**Simone Weil**](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18395.Simone_Weil)


Feeling too much passion and attachment towards something can skew our perception of it.

It can make us unwilling to accept the possibility of things going wrong. It can make us unwilling to see the flaws in our plan. It can make us oblivious to the truth that is right in front of us. Be it in our work, in our relationships or anything else in our life that we feel strongly passionate about, we all have a tendency to look at it in a skewed manner. So if the ceiling breaks and things go wrong one after the other, because sometimes they do despite your best efforts, you might find yourself really struggling to cope up.
