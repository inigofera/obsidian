"Content should be treated as a living, breathing thing, with a lifecycle, behaviors and attributes."

### Concept
Objects here are to be understood as OOP objects.

A website content must have:
- A consistent and recognizable internal structure (such as the different ingredients of a recipe)
- A discrete set of behaviors (such as how recipes can have variations or can become more or less important)


### Application

Taking for example a recipe website:
- Recipes have a **predictable internal structure**:
	- For a single recipe, there is a clear model of what kind of information it will have to include (ingredients, quantities, steps, prep time...).
	- This basic structure provides us with different ways to sort, expose, classify and connect instances of recipes together.
	- This predictable structure that enables building relationships.
- Recipes also have **clear, discrete behaviors**:
	- Recipes gain or lose importance depending on the time of the year (stews in F/W, fresh salads in S/F).
	- Recipes can be replicated by other users with their own twist.
	- The content has predictable ways in which it can behave.
