User Experience Design uses research data of different kinds to determine how to provide an optimal user experience. This data helps researchers understand the target audience, reveals information about the user's pain points, discovers new trends and assures teams that their work is on track.

### The impact of data on [[Design Thinking|UX Design]]

 Two types:
 - **Quantitative:** Numerical data that shows _who, what, when and where_. The only thing it doesn't talk to us about is _why_. Quantitative data can be extracted from direct analysis of the usage of the service.
 - **Qualitative:** Data that tells us _why_ and _how_. It can help us understand not just what happens, but the causes and motivations behind it. This type of data is collected through talking to our users.

Data-driven design is important because it helps us:
1.  **Understand** users and their needs
	- Even if the designs are initially good, it is important to have a constant stream of information that confirms the effectiveness of the design.
	- This is especially important to avoid bias. The designer might not be in the target audience, so they might not be aware of the exact needs and expectations of the target users. This knowledge gap can be bridged with user research.
2.  **Move beyond** best practices
	- Data makes it so that UX designers don't have to make assumptions. Having empathy with the user is much more valuable than following the latest design trends or following the most popular design guidelines.
3.  **Create** effective and aware designs
	- User experience analytics inform UX design. A spike or a drop in a certain metric could mean that users' expectations with a product could not be being met accurately.
	- An overarching strategy is important. Even if a metric goes down for a smaller section, the overarching performance could be going up.
4.  **Leverage data** to drive innovation
	- Designers can—and should—be able to propose drastic, daring changes. If designers want to propose innovative designs, they should back up their design hypotheses with data.
