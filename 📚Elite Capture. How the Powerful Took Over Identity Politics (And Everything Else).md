Elite Capture describes how political projects are hijacked in principle or in practice by the well-positioned and resourced.

It is Elite Capture, and not Identity Politics itself, that stands between (the working class) and a transformative, non-sectarian, coalitional politics.

In a broader sense: What we do, what we eat, what we watch, what we talk about... All these choices are made within an array of possibilities that is to a great extent manufactured by elites.
