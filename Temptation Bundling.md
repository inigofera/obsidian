Technique that makes boring tasks more attractive by bundling them up with more attractive tasks.

The main idea is to take one thing that you must do but you don't want to, and combine it with a more appealing task in the following way:
- I can do (THING I WANT) but only after I (THING I MUST DO).

By combining the execution of the hard task that we're not normally motivated by with the immediate reward of the task that is appealing to us, we can be more motivated to do the hard task.
