Suffering can be physical or mental and can manifest as pain, frustration, anxiety, or dissatisfaction. The Buddha taught that suffering is a universal experience and that it arises from the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and uncontrollable nature of life.

According to the Buddha, suffering arises from three types of dukkha:

1.  Ordinary Suffering (dukkha-dukkha) - this refers to physical and mental pain and discomfort, such as illness, injury, grief, anxiety, and frustration.

2.  Suffering of Change (viparinama-dukkha) - this refers to the fact that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent and subject to change. Even experiences that may be pleasant or enjoyable are ultimately unsatisfactory because they are impermanent and subject to change.

3.  Inherent Suffering (sankhara-dukkha) - this refers to the fundamental unsatisfactoriness of all conditioned existence. Because everything is impermanent, there is no lasting happiness or security to be found in the world.
