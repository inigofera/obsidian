One of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].

This truth recognizes that all sentient beings experience some level of [[Suffering]].

The Buddha taught that the experience of suffering is a natural and inevitable part of life, and that it arises from the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and uncontrollable nature of existence. However, the Buddha also taught that it is possible to transcend suffering by developing wisdom and compassion and by following [[The Noble Eightfold Path]].

By acknowledging and accepting the truth of suffering, one can cultivate a deeper understanding of the human experience and develop greater empathy and compassion for oneself and others. In this way, the truth of suffering serves as a starting point for the spiritual journey towards liberation and the end of suffering.
