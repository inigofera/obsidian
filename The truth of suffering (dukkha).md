One of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].

This truth recognizes that all sentient beings experience some level of suffering. Suffering can be physical or mental and can manifest as pain, frustration, anxiety, or dissatisfaction. The Buddha taught that suffering is a universal experience and that it arises from the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and uncontrollable nature of life.

According to the Buddha, suffering arises from three types of dukkha:

1.  Ordinary Suffering (dukkha-dukkha) - this refers to physical and mental pain and discomfort, such as illness, injury, grief, anxiety, and frustration.

2.  Suffering of Change (viparinama-dukkha) - this refers to the fact that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent and subject to change. Even experiences that may be pleasant or enjoyable are ultimately unsatisfactory because they are impermanent and subject to change.

3.  Inherent Suffering (sankhara-dukkha) - this refers to the fundamental unsatisfactoriness of all conditioned existence. Because everything is impermanent, there is no lasting happiness or security to be found in the world.


The Buddha taught that the experience of suffering is a natural and inevitable part of life, and that it arises from the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and uncontrollable nature of existence. However, the Buddha also taught that it is possible to transcend suffering by developing wisdom and compassion and by following the Eightfold Path.

By acknowledging and accepting the truth of suffering, one can cultivate a deeper understanding of the human experience and develop greater empathy and compassion for oneself and others. In this way, the truth of suffering serves as a starting point for the spiritual journey towards liberation and the end of suffering.
