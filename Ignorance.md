Ignorance (avijja in Pali) refers to a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of reality. Specifically, it is the failure to see things as they truly are, which leads to [[Suffering]] and delusion.

Ignorance arises from a mistaken belief in a permanent, unchanging, and independent self or soul. This belief creates a sense of separateness and reinforces the idea that we are distinct and autonomous beings who are separate from the rest of the world. This sense of separateness leads to craving and attachment, which in turn leads to suffering.

The Buddha taught that ignorance is the root cause of all suffering, and that the way to overcome it is through developing wisdom and insight. This involves understanding that all things are impermanent, constantly changing, and devoid of a separate and enduring self.

By recognizing the true nature of existence, we can begin to see through the illusions created by ignorance and develop a more skillful and compassionate way of relating to the world. This involves letting go of our attachments and cultivating a sense of interconnectedness and interdependence with all things. Through the practice of mindfulness and meditation, we can learn to see things as they truly are and develop a more profound understanding of the nature of reality.
