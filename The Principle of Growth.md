"Assume that the content you have today is a small fraction of the content you will have tomorrow."

### Concept
- The Web has more content than yesterday and less than tomorrow.
- The digital storage of information comes with (virtually) limitless space, but the presentation of and access to that information must conform, on some levels, with the limitations of users' cognitive and ergonomic limits.

### Application
- A website or online service can grow in several directions, at once or at different times. It is impossible to predict what will happen:
	- It can add more content to existing categories (Adding more recipes to the Fall/Winter category)
	- It can add different types of content to existing categories (Incorporation of video recipes to a previously text-only format)
	- It can create new categories (Restaurant reviews aside from recipes).
- Information architects should try to prepare for the possibility of growth as much as possible. They need to create designs that could potentially accommodate for new kinds of contents:
	- Menus should be prepared to incorporate new topics.
	- Destination pages should be prepared to accommodate new content types.
	- Etc.
