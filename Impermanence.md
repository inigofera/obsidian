Impermanence (also known as anicca in Pali) refers to the understanding that all phenomena are constantly changing and in a state of flux. This includes everything from material objects and physical sensations to emotions, thoughts, and mental states.

According to the Buddha, everything that exists is subject to impermanence, including all living beings, as well as inanimate objects. This means that all things are subject to birth, change, and eventual decay and cessation. Nothing in the universe is permanent, unchanging, or eternal.

Impermanence is considered one of the three universal characteristics of existence, along with [[Suffering]] (dukkha) and [[Non-self]] (anatta). Understanding and accepting impermanence is seen as a key aspect of spiritual practice, as it can help to reduce attachment, craving, and suffering.

The realization of impermanence is said to be a transformative experience that can lead to greater wisdom and insight into the nature of reality. Through the practice of mindfulness and meditation, we can learn to observe and accept the impermanence of all phenomena, and develop a greater appreciation for the present moment.

In Buddhism, impermanence is not seen as a negative or pessimistic view of the world, but rather as a liberating and empowering insight. By recognizing the transitory nature of all things, we can let go of our attachment to them, and live more fully and freely in the present moment.
