Personal Finance is different for everyone. Looking at my particular case, I consider myself extremely privileged when it comes to this topic.

Most of the PF content I have consumed aimed at young adults (especially the one coming from the US) has a very reactive nature, mostly assuming that recently graduated students are looking for an eventual way out of their crippling student debt. I, however, do not have that problem, so a lot of the techniques discussed in those resources does not land with me.

My parents have never struggled financially, and, as an extension of this, I have never struggled financially. Their philosophy towards financially caring for me, while not stated by them explicitly to me, was always "you focus on your studies, we'll take care of the rest". While I acknowledge how immensely lucky I was to have that kind of opportunity, it may have had the unintended side effect of not letting me develop sustainable spending habits from earlier on in my life. I did not get obscene amounts of money from them, but it was enough so that I did not really have to worry about it that much.

I do no longer depend financially on my parents. I have a 9 to 5 in the tech industry and have relative stability. Aside from this, I also retain my parental safety net. It is not something I would actively rely on, but I know that, if I ever fall on hard times, my parents will have my back until I can become independent again.

Even still, I can't help but be extremely worried about my financial future. As a terminally online doomscroller (much to my dismay and in the midst of reformation, if it serves as consolation), I am constantly reading about macroeconomic shifts that gurus interpret as harbingers of financial doom for everyone (especially younger people).
