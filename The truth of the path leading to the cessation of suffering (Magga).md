One of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].

This truth teaches that there is a path that leads to the cessation of suffering. This path is [[The Noble Eightfold Path]], which includes right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

By cultivating these eight factors, one can gradually develop the wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline needed to transform one's mind and attain liberation from suffering. The Eightfold Path is often depicted as a wheel with eight spokes, symbolizing the interconnectedness and interdependence of the different aspects of the path.
