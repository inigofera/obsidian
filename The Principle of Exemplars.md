"Describe the contents of categories by showing examples of the contents."

### Concept
Psychologists have discovered that our brains represent information categories by networks of good examples.

### Application
- Whenever a category name is displayed, a few examples of content that lives in that category should also be displayed. This serves two functions:
	- Give the users quick access to the most frequently used areas of each category.
	- Provide users with a preview of the lower level categories they will be able to find in that category.
- Example of Netflix recommending you a category
	- Shows you the title
	- Shows you a couple images of shows/movies you have watched from that category to:
		- Justify showing you that category
		- Provide you with a quick impression of the recommendation topic
	- Shows you a couple images of shows/movies of that category that you could watch.
	- Has a link to expand that category.
