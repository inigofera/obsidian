_If the weather forecast for your destination isn’t totally clear, it probably isn’t worth making the journey!_

If you want to climb the mountain, you have to spend a night there. Otherwise, if you just want to do stuff in its vicinity, it can be a day trip starting from some city. I have to make the decision of whether I want to actually go to the summit or just go to a place to see it nicely.
