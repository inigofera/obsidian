As a young male with a 9 to 5 job, there are several ways you can put the concept of renunciation into practice in your daily life:

1.  Cultivate [[Mindfulness]]: One of the key aspects of renunciation is developing a deeper awareness of your thoughts, feelings, and actions. By practicing mindfulness meditation, you can learn to observe your thoughts and emotions without getting caught up in them. This can help you develop greater clarity and insight into your own mind, and cultivate a more balanced and equanimous approach to life.

2.  Practice [[Moderation]]: While it may not be possible to completely give up all worldly pleasures and desires, you can cultivate a more moderate approach to them. For example, you can practice moderation in your consumption of food, entertainment, or material possessions. This can help you develop a greater sense of contentment and reduce your attachment to external things.

3.  Volunteer or engage in acts of service: Engaging in acts of service or volunteering can be a powerful way to cultivate a sense of compassion and altruism, and reduce your attachment to self-centered concerns. You can look for opportunities to volunteer in your community or participate in charitable organizations that align with your values.

4.  Set aside time for spiritual practice: Even with a busy work schedule, it's important to set aside time for spiritual practice. This can include meditation, reading Buddhist texts, attending dharma talks or group discussions, or participating in retreats. By making spiritual practice a priority, you can cultivate greater wisdom, compassion, and inner peace.


Renunciation is not about denying yourself pleasure or happiness, but rather cultivating a deeper sense of satisfaction and contentment that is not dependent on external circumstances or conditions. By integrating these practices into your daily life, you can develop a more balanced and fulfilling way of living, even while working a 9 to 5 job.
