[[Productivity]] framework by Tiago Forte.

## Main Concepts

Stands for:
- **Projects**: A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.
- **Areas**: Spheres of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.
- **Resources**: Topic or theme of ongoing interest.
- **Archives**: Inactive items from the other 3 categories.

## Characteristics
- **Universal**: Can accommodate any kind of information, from any source.
- **Flexible**: Can adapt to any project or activity, in the present and in the future.
- **Simple**: Doesn't require maintenance, cataloging info, tagging or reorganizing to a great extent.
- **Actionable**: It integrates nicely with other task/project management methods.
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with any application, in the present and in the future.
- **Outcome-oriented**: It structures information in a way that supports the delivery of valuable work.
- **Modular**: Allows different levels of detail to be revealed or hidden, depending on the needs of the current task.
- **Opportunistic**: (in the good sense), taking advantage of existing work to eliminate dedicated overhead time.
