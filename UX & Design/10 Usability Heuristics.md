As described by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), the Ten [[Usability]] Heuristics are the following:

1. Visibility of system status
	- The system should communicate clearly to users what its state is. No action with consequences to users should be taken without informing them.
	- The system should present the users with feedback as quick as possible after these actions are taken (ideally, immediately).
	- This can help build trust through continuous communication.
2. Match between system and real world
	- The system should ensure that users can understand all its features without having to look up any word or concept.
	- A designer should never assume that the user's understading of words or concepts will match his or hers.
	- Through user research, the users' familiar terminology can be discovered, as well as their mental models around important concepts.
3. User control and freedom
	- Systems should account for the fact that users often make actions by mistake.
	- The system should support Undo and Redo functions, when relevant.
	- The system should always show a clear way to stop the current interaction, through for example a Cancel button.
	- The exit should always be clearly labeled and discoverable.
4. Consistency and standards
	- Systems should acknowledge [[Jakob's Law]], which states that people spend most of their time using digital products other than said system. Users' experience with those other products set their expectations when using our system.
	- Not maintaining consistency may increase the users' cognitive load by forcing them to figure a new concept out.
	- Systems should improve learnability by maintaining internal and external consistency (consistency within itself and with the rest of digital products out there).
5. Error prevention
	- Systems should acknowledge the difference between slips and mistakes (slips are unconscious errors caused by not paying attention, mistakes are errors caused by a mismatch between the design and the user's mental model).
	- Systems should prioritize preventing high-cost errors first, and focus on small bugs later.
	- Systems should avoid slips by providing helpful constraints and good default options.
	- Systems should prevent mistakes by removing memory burdens, supporting the undo function and warning the users about consequences to their actions.
6. Recognition rather than recall
	- Systems should let users recognize information in the interface, rather than having to remember (recall) it.
	- Systems should provide help in context, instead of dumping a lot of information for the user to memorize.
	- Overall, the system should try to minimize the information that the user needs to remember.
7. Felixibility and efficiency of use
	- Systems should cater to inexperienced and experienced users alike.
	- Systems should provide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts or touch gestures.
	- Systems should aim to provide personalization by tailoring content and functionality for individual users.
	- Systems should allow for customization so users can make selections about how they want the product to work.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
	- Systems should keep the content and visual design of the UI focused on the essentials.
	- Systems should not have unnecessary elements that distract users from the information they really need.
	- Systems should prioritize the content and features that support primary goals inside the system.
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
	- Systems should use traditional and recognizable error visuals, like bol red text.
	- Systems should tell users what is wrong in language they will understand, avoiding technical jargon.
	- Systems should offr users a solution to errors, like a shortcut to solve the error immediately.
10. Help and documentation
	- Systems should ensure that the help and documentation it offers is easy to access and search.
	- Systems, whenever possible, should present the documentation in context right at the moment that the user requires it.
	- Systems should provide users with concrete step by step lists to be carried out in certain context to achieve certain objectives.
