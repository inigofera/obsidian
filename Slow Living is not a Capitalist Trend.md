- The Left is always pushing for "less work" â†’ perceived as lazy.
- [[Capitalist Realism]] has made it so that we only consider our 9 to 5 or our side hustle as what is "being productive".
- Slow Living opens up space for other concepts of work, other concepts of fulfillment.
	- Artistic
	- Social
	- Political
- Slow Living is anti-capitalist.
	- It goes against the growth mindset and the short-term orientation of this system.
	- Makes us need less and produce less.
