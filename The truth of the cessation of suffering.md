One of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].

This truth teaches that it is possible to end suffering by letting go of [[Craving]] and [[Attachment]]. The Buddha taught that it is possible to attain a state of peace and happiness by developing [[Detachment]], and by cultivating wisdom and compassion.
