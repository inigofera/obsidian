"Offer users several different classification schemes to browse the site's content."

### Concept
- People have different ways of looking for information. 
- A good classification scheme aims to provide simple ways for finding information across this range.
	- A classification scheme describes what labels are used to categorize the website's content.


### Application
An example of a company intranet:
- People looking for the vacation policy could:
	- Look up the topic (vacation)
	- Look up by content type (policy, form)
	- Look up by department (HR)
- Navigation mechanisms incorporate all of these classification schemes in ways that let users employ them independently but also combine them as necessary.
- This principle is a double-edged sword, however. Providing multiple ways to find content benefits users, but providing too many ways can overwhelm and distract them.
