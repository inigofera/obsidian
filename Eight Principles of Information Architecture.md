These principles can guide design decisions but don't necessarily dictate a particular approach.

### Assumptions
- The priority is the structure and then the UI.
- Comprehensive [[User Research]] has been conducted.
- The entirety of the content and functionality that needs to be supported is known by the information architect.

## The Principles
1. [[The Principle of Objects]] - Content should be treated as a living, breathing thing, with a lifecycle, behaviors and attributes.
2. [[The Principle of Choices]] - Pages must be created that offer meaningful choices to users, keeping the range of choices available focused on a particular task.
3. [[The Principle of Disclosure]] - Only enough information should be shown to users so that they understand what kinds of information they will find as they dig deeper.
4. [[The Principle of Exemplars]] - Describe the contents of categories by showing examples of the contents.
5. [[The Principle of Front Doors]] - Assume at least half of the website visitors will come through some page other than the home page.
6. [[The Principle of Multiple Classification]] - Offer users several different classification schemes to browse the site's content.
7. [[The Principle of Focused Navigation]] - Don't mix apples with oranges in your navigation scheme.
8. [[The Principle of Growth]] - Assume that the content you have today is a small fraction of the content you will have tomorrow.
