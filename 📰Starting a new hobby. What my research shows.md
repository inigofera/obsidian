Starting something new reminds us how important it is to tolerate our own incompetence and imperfection. And while these two words may sound familiar and accurate, they are also needlessly punitive and ultimately harmful. They lead us to give up before we’ve begun.

At the beginning of anything, we are, of course, beginners. And we will inevitably face outcomes that don’t match our expectations. But forgiving ourselves for not being experts, keeping our heads up and our minds open to learning from our mistakes allows us to continue on the path we’ve chosen. No doubt you will hear the voice of your inner critic trying to convince you that you’re not even qualified to be on the path in the first place. And that thinking is dead wrong.

We should focus on enjoying the process — fuck ups and all — rather than focusing on outcomes. Learning to enjoy the process without reliance on the outcome will likely require you to sit down to a conversation with your inner critic. This intervention is simple but not easy. As you know, your inner critic relishes giving you a hard time for making mistakes or feeling unmotivated or not knowing just what to do in a given situation. This is unfortunate because it’s completely fucking okay for you to fuck up or to feel frustrated by fucking up. And while it’s virtually impossible to limit your inner critic’s airtime, you can definitely limit its authority.
