1. Embrace curiosity and exploration, but manage it effectively to avoid diluting your focus across too many activities.
2. Write down a [[Hierarchy of Interests]]. Ask what's most important. Prioritize your interests by ranking them based on importance to create a realistic plan for improvement.
3. Implement effective time management techniques such as scheduling on Google Calendar to align with your priorities.
4. Allocate time according to your priorities, giving more time to what matters most while still making room for less important activities. 
5. Temporarily defer less important interests to focus on the ones that matter most in the present.
6. Reframe existing daily activities to improve skills without adding extra time to your schedule. - "If I can't avoid it, I may as well get good at it."
7. Be mindful of shiny object syndrome triggered by social media, and focus on your own valuable skills rather than feeling inadequate.
8. Be aware that following interests is not always fun. Understand and navigate the emotional stages of skill development, pushing through challenges to achieve mastery.
