- Expose yourself to a lot of things (within the topic you want to get good taste in)
- Learn to analyze everything:
	- Do not take anything at face value. 
	- Even if at first glance it seems like something cannot enrich or offer you anything, learn to dedicate it the time it deserves.

- Three keys (similar to building muscle):
	- Large volume: Consume a lot of the subject.
	- Large intensity: Dedicate effort to its analysis.
	- Consistency: Do this for an extended period of time.

- Most importantly:
	- How do I (me as a person) relate to all of this? 
	- How does my taste influence my self? How does who I am influence my taste?
