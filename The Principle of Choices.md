"Pages must be created that offer meaningful choices to users, keeping the range of choices available focused on a particular task."

### Concept
Users think they like having a lot of options, but in reality they do not. 

A well-designed website must offer users concise choices that don't overwhelm them.

### Application
- At least in the upper levels of the site's hierarchy, things should be more spread out.
- Users should not have to traverse long lists of options in search of what they are looking for.
