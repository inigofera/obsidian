The Four Noble Truths are the central teachings of [[Buddhism]], and they form the foundation of the Buddha's teachings. The Four Noble Truths are as follows:

1.  [[The truth of suffering (dukkha)]]: This truth recognizes that all sentient beings experience some level of suffering. Suffering can be physical or mental and can manifest as pain, frustration, anxiety, or dissatisfaction. The Buddha taught that suffering is a universal experience and that it arises from the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and uncontrollable nature of life.

2.  [[The truth of the cause of suffering]] (Samudaya): This truth teaches that the root cause of suffering is craving and attachment. Craving arises from a sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are, and it leads to attachment to things that are impermanent and ultimately unsatisfactory. The Buddha taught that this craving and attachment are the cause of all suffering.

3.  [[The truth of the cessation of suffering]] (Nirodha): This truth teaches that it is possible to end suffering by letting go of craving and attachment. The Buddha taught that it is possible to attain a state of peace and happiness by developing detachment, and by cultivating wisdom and compassion.

4.  [[The truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering]] (Magga): This truth teaches that there is a path that leads to the cessation of suffering. This path is the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.


The Four Noble Truths provide a framework for understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation from it. By recognizing the truth of suffering, understanding its cause, realizing that it is possible to end it, and following the path to do so, one can attain a state of lasting peace and happiness.
