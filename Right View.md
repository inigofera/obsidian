First step on the Noble Eightfold Path in [[Buddhism]]. It is considered the foundation of the path as it lays the groundwork for understanding the nature of reality and the [[Four Noble Truths]].

Right View is essentially about understanding the world as it is, and recognizing the true nature of existence. It involves understanding the following:

1.  The [[Four Noble Truths]] - the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering.

2.  The law of [[Karma]] - the understanding that actions have consequences, and that good actions lead to positive outcomes and bad actions lead to negative outcomes.

3.  The concept of [[Impermanence]] - the understanding that all phenomena are in a constant state of change and nothing is permanent.

4.  The three characteristics of existence - the understanding that all things are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not self.

5.  The concept of dependent origination - the understanding that all things arise in dependence upon other conditions and that everything is interconnected.

Right View is not just about intellectual understanding but also about direct experience and realization of these truths. It is said that developing Right View leads to a shift in perspective and a deepening of insight that helps one to see the world in a more accurate and compassionate way, and to live a life that is in harmony with the nature of reality.
