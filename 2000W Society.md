The 2000-Watt Society represents a sustainable and socially just society. For every person on earth, 2000 watts of continuous power (primary energy) are available. This is enough to ensure prosperity and a high quality of life. Today, the primary energy consumption per capita worldwide is on average 2500 watts – with enormous country-specific differences. At present, each Swiss inhabitant uses about 4700 watts. The CO2 emissions caused by this level of energy consumption must not exceed 1 tonne per person per year.

Basically, three strategies exist to meet the goals of the 2000-Watt Society:
-   Efficiency: use less energy for the same purpose.
-   Consistency: use renewable instead of non-renewable energy resources; use environmentally-friendly technologies; reuse and recycle.
-   Sufficiency: use less, for a better quality of life.
