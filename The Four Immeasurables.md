The Four Immeasurables, also known as the Brahmaviharas, are a set of four virtues or qualities that are central to Buddhist practice. They are:

1.  Loving-kindness (Metta): This is the practice of developing unconditional love and kindness towards all living beings, including oneself, regardless of their actions or behavior.

2.  [[Compassion]] (Karuna): This is the practice of recognizing and responding to the suffering of others with kindness, empathy, and understanding.

3.  Sympathetic joy (Mudita): This is the practice of rejoicing in the happiness and success of others, rather than feeling jealousy or resentment.

4.  Equanimity (Upekkha): This is the practice of maintaining a calm and balanced mind in the face of both positive and negative experiences, and treating all beings with equal respect and compassion.


Together, the Four Immeasurables are believed to be a powerful tool for developing positive emotions, reducing suffering, and cultivating a sense of interconnectedness with all living beings. By practicing these qualities, Buddhists seek to cultivate a more peaceful and harmonious world, both within themselves and in their relationships with others.
