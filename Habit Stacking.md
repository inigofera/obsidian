From the book [[ðŸ“šAtomic Habits]].

Technique that makes you take advantage of existing habits to crate new ones.

Steps:
1. Identify an existing, consistent habit that you already have.
2. Stack a habit that you want to create on top of it.
	- Key sentence: AFTER (EXISTING HABIT) I WILL (NEW HABIT).
1. Repeat until the new potential habit becomes ingrained in your life.

Keys for success:
1. Should be a manageable habit, nothing too big to start. Small incremental progress.
2. The new habit should be stacked with another habit whose timeframe makes sense. If you want to do something every day, you should stack it with another thing you do everyday, not more and not less often.
