- My nails start to grow again
- We need to take the cat to the vet
	- You can do the meal prep while I go
- Hands calloused from bouldering
- We never check our phones anymore


You looked at me today

I sleep too little.
I eat too much. I drink too much coffee.
I look too much at my phone. I don't talk to my mom enough.
I don't talk to my grandma enough.
I don't save enough money.
I don't work hard enough.
I'm not patient enough. I don't enjoy life enough.
I don't enjoy my youth enough. I don't live enough.
I don't put enough effort.
Nothing ever feels like it's enough.
