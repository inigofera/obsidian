One of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].

This truth teaches that the root cause of suffering is [[Craving]] and [[Attachment]]. Craving arises from a sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are, and it leads to attachment to things that are impermanent and ultimately unsatisfactory. The Buddha taught that this craving and attachment are the cause of all suffering.
