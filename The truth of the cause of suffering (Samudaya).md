One of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of Buddhism.

This truth teaches that the root cause of suffering is [[Craving]] and [[Attachment]]. Craving arises from a sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are, and it leads to attachment to things that are impermanent and ultimately unsatisfactory. The Buddha taught that this craving and attachment are the cause of all suffering.

According to the Buddha, the cause of suffering is not external circumstances but rather our own inner state. We experience suffering because we crave and cling to things that are impermanent and ultimately unsatisfactory. We may crave for pleasant experiences, material possessions, social status, or even for spiritual attainment. However, the problem with craving is that it creates a sense of lack, which leads to attachment and suffering.
