World Wars were "a generation-long orgy of wealth destruction" that weakened the power of the ruling class to such a low ebb that it could no longer drown the (working class') centuries-long dream of mobility and egalitarianism.

After the wars, rich countries instituted ambitious social safety networks: universal secondary education, increased access to tertiary education, public housing, free healthcare for everyone...

Unions became common, and as productivity improved, wages rose. Struggles for gender justice expanded beyond a campaign for votes for wealthy white women and into universal suffrage. Civil rights struggles on racial, gender and sexual orientation lines came to the fore, and formed alliances with one another, and with anti-colonial movements in the global south.
