One of the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].

This truth recognizes that all sentient beings experience some level of suffering. Suffering can be physical or mental and can manifest as pain, frustration, anxiety, or dissatisfaction. The Buddha taught that suffering is a universal experience and that it arises from the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and uncontrollable nature of life.
