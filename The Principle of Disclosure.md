"Only enough information should be shown to users so that they understand what kinds of information they will find as they dig deeper."

### Concept
- [[Progressive Disclosure]] - We can only process so much information at once, but we can use what we have to anticipate what is to come.
- "Information presented to a user that is not interested or ready to process it is effectively noise."

### Application
Content should be thought about in terms of layers:
- A site presents different layers of the same content in different areas of the site.
- (Recipes example) Can't show recipes in its entirety on every page. Should only show key info points (title, picture, prep time) to give users a taste of what they'll be able to see if they expand on the recipe.
