Microcopy: Text we use to design interfaces and create engaging products.

A large percentage of the microcopy is directly related to actions the user should take, such as:
-   Onboarding a new user and general product guidance
-   Making users buy more products
-   Encouraging the user to carry out an action
-   Guiding the user through the execution of an action
-   Giving feedback and clarifying the results of an action that was taken

Not all microcopy is for advertising. When it comes to apps and websites, the best microcopy should make the user feel as if they are communicating with a real person rather than just a digital interface. The role of the UX writer is to bring this goal to fruition, which has the power to make or break a product.
