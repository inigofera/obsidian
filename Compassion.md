In Buddhism, compassion is an important quality that refers to the act of recognizing and responding to the suffering of others. It is one of [[The Four Immeasurables]] or brahmaviharas, along with loving-kindness, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.

Compassion is considered a central aspect of Buddhist practice and is cultivated through the development of mindfulness, wisdom, and meditation. By recognizing the suffering of others and responding with compassion, Buddhists seek to develop a sense of [[Interconnectedness]] with all living beings and to reduce the suffering in the world.

Compassion is not just an emotional response, but a way of being in the world. It involves an active effort to alleviate the suffering of others, whether through acts of kindness, generosity, or service. By cultivating compassion, Buddhists seek to develop a deeper sense of empathy, kindness, and understanding towards themselves and others, and to create a more peaceful and harmonious world.
