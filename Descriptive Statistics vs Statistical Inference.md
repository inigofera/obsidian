- **Descriptive Statistics**: Methods used to summarize the information contained in a sample using numerical indicators or graphs.
- **Statistical Inference**: Methods to draw conclusions applicable to a target population based on a sample

### Example
- Box with thousands of marbles inside of it. The marbles are either white or black.
- The only way to study the contents of this box is to take a sample of the marbles inside.
- If we grab a handful of 9 marbles and get 5 black ones and 4 white ones, we can:
	- Say that there are 4/9 white marbles in the sample (Descriptive Statistics), or
	- Infer that less than half of the marbles **in the box** are white (Statistical Inference).
- The question is, is the sample extracted enough to make inferences about the entire box?
