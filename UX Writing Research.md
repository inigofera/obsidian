As a UX writer, all the copy you write, the features you propose, and the design suggestions you make should be informed by UX research.

**UX research incorporates a wide array of methods that help us understand the needs and goals of the end user.** It shows us who our target audience is, allowing us to learn about that audience. To do this, we might conduct interviews, surveys, observe prospects and potential users, and examine existing literature and data. This allows us to understand how we can create a conversational product for our target audience.
